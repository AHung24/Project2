Where is the Love for Each Other?
## project overview
This project will revolve around the song "Where is the Love?" by The Black Eyed Peas, a song that calls attention to injustice, hate, and division in the world. Each page highlights one to two lines from the song while using CSS animation and design to pull the emotional and societal weight of the lyrics.
### technical overview
This project uses HTML and CSS to animate lyrics from Where is the Love? by The Black Eyed Peas. Each page features keyframe animations using transform and opacity to emphasize the emotion of the words. Absolute positioning and scaling are used to break from normal layouts and create a visual on the songâ€™s themes of uneasiness. The typography is expressive and uses the Sail font to create a cohesive hierarchy.

##### Process
The project began with selecting the most impactful lyrics from Where is the Love? By The Black Eyed Peas. I cut down much of the song to a few lines that I felt would resonate the most with the audience. I sketched rough layouts and conceptualized how the words would move. I also experimented with CSS animations to find the right spacing and movement. Through multiple iterations, I refined the timing, positioning, and typography to create a cohesive and simple layout that highlighted the tone of the lyrics. The process involved continuous testing and adjustments to ensure the animations felt smooth and correct.
